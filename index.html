                  <p class="paragraph">For my final project at General Assembly, I decided to revisit my first project which was a JavaScript online version of SIMON, a famous electronic game of memory skill from the late 70's.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">But this time I wanted to build it thinking of the blind, and with a mobile first design approach it allowed blind people to play the game taking advantage of the mobile device touchscreen capability.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">The mechanics of the game is simple: there is a board divided into four square sections. Each one has a different colour and a round of the game consists of a pattern in which one or more of this squares change its colour into a lighter one (it's like blinking); then, after that, the player has to touch/click the screen to repeat in order that pattern to score and to advance to the next level.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">There is no winner at the end, but there is a hall of fame in which it is lists the ten logged players who have the highest scores.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">Technologies: My aim was to use a full-stack architecture based on one of the frameworks I learnt in this course to build a working game application. I'm using NodeJS as server, Express for routing, MongoDB/ Mongoose to record data from the players, and nodemailer module as a mailing system.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">For the front-end I built a single page application with AngularJS and jQuery making the application react faster and giving users a better experience. For styles, I'm using PureCSS and a cool library called animateCSS.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph">Enduring a three-month discovery journey is part of the process, but it was worth it. Now I'm confident to say that I am a Web Developer, even knowing that I'm just arriving to this entire new world and that it will be a never-ending learning process. Fortunately I'm the kind of person who is eager for that knowledge trip.</p><p class="paragraph">The British Tech scene made me leave my country, Spain, to come and live here: I just wanted to be in the place where companies like Citymapper, Transferwise, Yplan, Sugru, BareConductive or Moo are doing amazing things and I wanted to be a part of it.</p><p class="paragraph">Count on me if you need a cross-border software dev, with creative and management experience.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph">I have been interested in technologies for many years but never had the opportunity to go in depth until I discovered General Assembly.
                  I have learnt loads of amazing and cool things you can do with a few lines of code, and how to put it together to build an application and send it out, to the whole world!</p>

                  <p class="paragraph">During this course I was taught both theoretical basis as well as practical skills. I attended regularly to classes during six months and spent 80 hours on a placement at a local school learning from an experienced teacher.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph">There, I met one of my best friends and art teacher who pushed me to move on and study Fine Arts at the University...</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">This is a short and simple story of what in reality happened: my parents wished I was a Doctor or something similar, so they did not support me too much; I failed three times in a row my A-Levels, then passed the fourth time, and tried a fifth time to get the punctuation needed to go to the Art University which I did (if you wonder, that was the Spanish educational system at that time); in the meantime, got a job as a waiter, helped to my art teacher in a regular basics as her personal assistant, and learnt a lot about life in general.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">How was my educational experience? It was terrific, fantastic! I will always say if I have the opportunity to return to start again, I will do it.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">In terms of what I learnt and what I ended being as an artist, it is something that happens to many artist: I started thinking of being a drawer and in the road I became interested in public art (political, and nature issues). In some pieces of art I started to use low tech hardware as light projectors, motion sensors...; one of my pieces consists in a fake online store.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph">On a regular basis, I've to evaluate web pages to estimate how much time it would require me to extract their data, I've to analise their HTML structure to find patterns which could allow me to improve the scraping process, and to add any modification needed to the script if that's the case.</p><p class="paragraph">After collecting data, I have to assess the quality of results returned, and to commit them to our online repository in GitLab if everything it's fine.</p><p class="paragraph">As a part of my position, I have to perform some tasks with our database (PostgreSQL), besides to update a spreadsheet with statistics from the scrape.</p>

                  <p class="paragraph-header-employment">Optical Assistant at Vision Express<br>Aug 2014 - Jul 2015 | London, UK</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">I consider this job as like a gym: I was improving my English and at the same time, I was moving around (upstairs, downstairs...), I was getting fit...</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">Anyway, basically I had to sell glasses and give our customers the best advice about their options related to their vision problems or/and their taste.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">Not having previous experience in the field was not an obstacle to be a valuable part of the team, and my experience in former job positions in which I had to deal with customers helped me. In addition, I am able to speak three languages on top of English language, so I could help foreign customers which was a plus.</p>
                  <p class="paragraph">Almost at the end of my period in this job the Store Manager put me on command of a team of three people in the sunglasses section.</p>
